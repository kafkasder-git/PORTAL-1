## Environment Issues

### Browser Console Logs Show:
1. **500 Internal Server Error** on initial login page
2. **No localStorage data** on page load
3. **No Set-Cookie header** in responses
4. **APPWRITE_API_KEY not defined** (server-side operations affected)

6. **Accessibility warnings** - Missing DialogTitle and aria-describedby attributes
7. **Controlled/Uncontrolled component warnings** in Select components

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Unarchive Appwrite Project** or migrate to a new project
2. **Fix Authentication** for non-admin users (verify credentials)
3. **Fix Form Submission** issues in Beneficiary and Donation forms
4. **Add Export Functionality** to Financial Reports page

### Short-term Actions (Medium Priority)
1. **Fix File Upload** functionality
2. **Fix Navigation Issues** preventing access to User List
3. **Improve Form Validation** - fix Select component controlled/uncontrolled issues
4. **Add Dialog Titles** and aria-describedby attributes for accessibility

### Long-term Actions (Low Priority)
1. **Add Comprehensive CSRF Testing** for POST requests
2. **Implement FCP Measurement** for performance benchmarking
3. **Fix Server SDK** usage in browser (use client SDK instead)

## Test Execution Details

- **Duration:** ~8 minutes
- **Total Actions:** 20 test cases
- **Success Rate:** 40%
- **Test Agent:** TestSprite AI
- **Proxy:** testsprite.com tunnel (port 56136)

## Conclusion

While 40% of tests passed, indicating core functionality like authentication, security, and basic UI works, there are critical blockers preventing full application testing:

1. **Appwrite project archive status** is the primary blocker
2. **Authentication system** needs verification for non-admin users
3. **Multiple CRUD operations** are failing due to UI interaction issues

**Next Steps:** Address the Appwrite project status first, then systematically fix authentication and form submission issues to enable comprehensive testing of all features.
